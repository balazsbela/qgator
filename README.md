qgator
======

qGrator is an a news site aggregator.The interface is implemented entirely in QML and uses QWebView to present content.
It currently pulls feeds from Hacker News and allows them to be displayed in QWebView.

It also allows search and makes use of many new Qt 5.0 features including json parsing and QtQuick 2.0.

It's a learning effort to familiarize myself with the new qt features and also the new C++ 11 features.
